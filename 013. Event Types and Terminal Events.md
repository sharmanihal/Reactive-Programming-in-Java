# Reactive Programming: Mono and Flux

## Key Concepts

In reactive programming, particularly when working with **Mono** and **Flux** (from Project Reactor), it's important to understand their behaviors and differences.

### Mono vs Flux

- **Mono**: Represents a sequence of 0 or 1 item(s).
- **Flux**: Represents a sequence of 0 or n item(s).

While both follow similar programming models, the main difference is in the number of items they can emit:

- **Mono** can return zero or one item.
- **Flux** can return zero or n items.

However, even though **Flux** can handle infinite streams, there is still a point where an observer may realize that no more items are forthcoming.

### Completion in Mono and Flux

Both **Mono** and **Flux** have the concept of a **completion event**. This is similar to the **Iterator pattern** where the producer stops when there's no more data.

- When a producer sends data, the observer is notified with either:
  - The item that needs to be processed.
  - A completion event indicating no more data is forthcoming.
  - A failure event indicating something went wrong.

The completion event signals that the sequence is done, and no more items will be emitted.

### Three Types of Events

- **Item**: The data that needs to be processed.
- **Completion**: The sequence is finished, no more items will be emitted.
- **Failure**: An error occurred during the sequence.

### Completion and Failure Events

Both **Mono** and **Flux** have terminal events:

- **Completion Event**: Once a **Mono** or **Flux** sends a completion event, no more items can be emitted. If a **Flux** sends a complete event, it cannot send any further events (not even another complete or failure event).
- **Failure Event**: Once a **Mono** or **Flux** sends a failure event, the stream is terminated. No more items or completion events will be sent after this.

### Behavior of Mono

- **Mono** can emit:
  - **Zero items**: The first event will be a completion event (possibly immediately, but not guaranteed).
  - **One item**: After emitting one item, it must immediately send a completion event (since **Mono** can only emit one item).
  - **Failure event**: It can emit a failure event instead of a value.

### Behavior of Flux

- **Flux** can emit:
  - **Zero items**: It can immediately send a completion event.
  - **A series of items**: It can emit multiple items and eventually send a completion event.
  - **Failure event**: It can emit a failure event immediately.
  - **Infinite streams**: It can send items continuously without a completion event, making the stream infinite.

### Terminal Events

- **Completion** and **Failure** are terminal events.
- Once a **Mono** or **Flux** sends a terminal event (completion or failure), no more events can be emitted.
- The only non-terminal event is an **item**. After an item is emitted by a **Flux**, there can still be more items. However, in **Mono**, once an item is emitted, it is followed only by a complete event, which terminates the sequence.

### Key Takeaways

- **Mono**:
  - Can send 0 or 1 item.
  - After emitting an item, it must emit a completion event.
  - It can also emit a failure event as the first event.

- **Flux**:
  - Can send 0 or more items.
  - It may never send a completion event if the stream is infinite.
  - It can emit failure events or completion events at any point.

- **Terminal Events**:
  - **Completion** and **Failure** events stop the sequence and prevent further items or events.

## Multi-threading and Reactive Programming

For multi-threading in reactive programming, the producer (in this case, the **Flux** or **Mono**) decides how and where to execute. The consumer is still receiving data and processing it, but the production logic is responsible for determining how threads are managed.

- The approach to multi-threading depends on the specific use case, especially when working in a reactive environment.
- You might use **Callable**, **Supplier**, or **CompletableFuture** depending on the requirements of the task.
