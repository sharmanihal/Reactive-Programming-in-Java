## The Spoiled State of Java Back-End Developers

As Java back-end developers, especially those working with frameworks like Spring Boot or Spring MVC, we are undeniably spoiled. Why? Because:

- **Concurrency is abstracted**: Spring MVC handles concurrency for us.
- **Single-request mindset**: When coding controller methods, we write them as if handling only a single request at a time, abstracting away simultaneous user requests.
- **Stateless methods**: These methods avoid side effects like modifying in-memory variables, which could lead to threading issues.

This abstraction comes at a cost: 

- **Sequential blocking operations**
- **Idling threads**

## The Problem: Blocking Operations

Imagine a scenario where you want to minimize blocking and have operations execute in parallel. Reactive programming is one approach, but Java provides concurrency APIs like `Future` and `CompletableFuture`. Let's explore how these APIs help and their limitations.

### `CompletableFuture`: The Basics

`CompletableFuture`, introduced in Java 8, extends the `Future` interface and offers:

- **Supply Async**: Converts long-running operations into asynchronous ones.
- **Completion Stage**: Coordinates multiple asynchronous operations.

Example:

### Benefits:
- Operations like `getUser` and `getPreferences` run in parallel.

### Problems:
1. **Blocking**: `join()` waits for results, causing blocking threads.
2. **Thread Usage**: Even when waiting, threads are consumed.
3. **Code Complexity**: Error handling and chaining async operations are messy.

Despite these efforts, the method ultimately blocks because:

- The return type (e.g., `User`) mandates waiting until results are available.

This paradigm limits scalability, as threads are consumed unnecessarily.

## The Need for a New Paradigm

### Limitations of the Current Approach:
- Blocking persists even in parallel execution.
- High thread consumption with minimal benefit.
- Developer overhead increases due to messy code and error handling.

### Solution: Reactive Programming
To overcome these issues:
1. **Eliminate Blocking**: Avoid `join()` or any form of blocking.
2. **Leverage Framework Support**: The framework must allow methods to return non-blocking types (e.g., `Mono`, `Flux` in Spring WebFlux).

Reactive programming provides a cleaner, more efficient approach to handling concurrency by:

- Embracing asynchronous and non-blocking paradigms.
- Reducing thread usage while handling high concurrency.

Transitioning to this paradigm not only enhances performance but also simplifies code by leveraging the framework's reactive capabilities.
