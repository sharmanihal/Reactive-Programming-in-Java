# Flux Subscribe Method and Event Completion

In the exercises two and three, after the numbers are emitted, you can see how the completion event works. Let's break it down:

## Subscribe Method Overview

We looked at the `subscribe()` method, which has multiple signatures. You can subscribe with nothing—i.e., without a lambda to execute. In this case, the Flux emits an event, but there's no listener, so the event will happen, but there’s no side effect to process it. 

This is a philosophical question—if a Flux emits an event and there’s no subscriber, does it even happen? Well, it does happen, but you won't know because there’s no listener to handle it.

## First Subscribe Signature

The first `subscribe` signature looks like this:

```java
flux.subscribe();
```

This means that the Flux emits events, but since there's no subscriber, it does nothing with the event. We’re just letting the Flux do its work without listening to it.

## Second Subscribe Signature

The second `subscribe` signature takes a **consumer**. This is a functional interface type that takes an element and processes it, but it doesn’t return anything. We’ve used this in previous examples, such as printing elements with `System.out.println`.

```java
flux.subscribe(element -> System.out.println(element));
```

This will call the provided lambda whenever an item is emitted by the Flux. However, it doesn’t handle completion or error events.

## Third Subscribe Signature

The third signature allows you to pass multiple lambdas for different events. For instance, when an item is emitted, you can execute the first lambda. If an error occurs, you execute the second lambda, and if the Flux completes, you run a third lambda.

```java
flux.subscribe(
  item -> System.out.println(item),       // Item handler
  error -> System.out.println(error.getMessage()), // Error handler
  () -> System.out.println("Completed!")   // Completion handler
);
```

This allows you to handle each event individually. Here’s how it works:
- The first lambda is called when an item is emitted.
- The second lambda is called when an error happens.
- The third lambda is called when the Flux completes successfully.

### Example

Let’s take a look at an example using a Mono that prints a number and then completes:

```java
Mono.just(10)
  .doOnTerminate(() -> System.out.println("Completed"))
  .subscribe(
    number -> System.out.println("Received: " + number),
    error -> System.out.println("Error: " + error.getMessage()),
    () -> System.out.println("Complete!")
  );
```

This will:
- Print the number when it is emitted.
- Immediately complete the Flux after the number is emitted.
- Print "Complete!" when the Flux completes.

## Exercise Five

Now it's your turn. Try subscribing to a Flux using the error and completion hooks. Here's a simple task:

- **Subscribe to a Flux** and see the results printed.
- If an error occurs, check if the rest of the items will be processed.
- Remember that the complete event is **not always executed**. It only happens when the Flux finishes successfully.

### Key Concepts:

- **Error and Completion are Terminal Events**: Once an error occurs or the Flux completes, no further events are emitted.
- **An Error Event Terminates the Flux**: If an error happens, no other events or completion will occur after that.
- **Completion Event**: This runs only when the Flux completes successfully.

### Exercise Instructions

- Try subscribing to a Flux (using a `Mono` or `Flux`).
- Test it by providing error and completion lambdas.
- If an error happens, the `complete` event will not execute, and vice versa.

```java
flux.subscribe(
  item -> System.out.println(item),       // Item handler
  error -> System.out.println("Error: " + error.getMessage()), // Error handler
  () -> System.out.println("Completed!")   // Completion handler
);
```

Once you complete the exercise, you'll understand how different event types are handled with the `subscribe()` method and its various signatures.
