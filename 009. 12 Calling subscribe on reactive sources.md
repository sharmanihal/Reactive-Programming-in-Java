# Exercise 2: Reactive Streams

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will work with reactive streams, specifically using `Flux` streams. These streams emit events over time, and we will subscribe to those events to perform actions when the events occur.

We will be using two types of reactive streams:

1. `int numbers flux` - A stream of integers.
2. `user flux` - A stream of user objects.

## Objective

The first task is to print all the numbers in the `int numbers flux`. To do this, we need to subscribe to the stream and print each element when it gets emitted.

### Code:

```java
Flux<Integer> numbersFlux = sources.getIntNumbersFlux();
numbersFlux.subscribe(number -> System.out.println(number));
```

### Explanation:

- `subscribe`: This method is the equivalent of `forEach` in the reactor world. It subscribes to the stream, and whenever an event is emitted, the provided lambda function (in this case, printing the number) will be executed.
- The `number` will be emitted every second.

### Program Flow:

1. The program subscribes to the `int numbers flux` stream and waits for the numbers to be emitted.
2. The `subscribe` method registers the action to be executed whenever a new number is emitted.
3. If no `Thread.sleep` or equivalent mechanism is added, the program may finish before the numbers are emitted, as the process will exit once the `main` method completes.

To keep the program running long enough to observe the emissions, a `Thread.sleep` or other delay is added:

```java
Thread.sleep(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds to let the stream emit events
```

This ensures that the program stays alive long enough to observe the emitted numbers.

### Example Output:

```
8
9
10
```

### Key Concepts:

- **Reactive Programming:** In reactive programming, you don't control the flow of events manually. Instead, you subscribe to a stream, and the stream controls when events are emitted and when your subscribed actions are executed.
- **Event Emission:** Events are emitted over time. Each emission is asynchronous and can occur at different intervals, depending on how the stream is configured.

## User Flux Stream

Now, let's work with another reactive stream: `user flux`, which emits user objects.

### Code:

```java
Flux<User> userFlux = sources.getUserFlux();
userFlux.subscribe(user -> System.out.println(user));
```

### Explanation:

- Similar to the previous example, we subscribe to the `user flux` stream and print each user object when it's emitted.
- Each user will be printed every second, as per the configuration of the stream.

### Example Output:

```
User{id=1, name='Alice'}
User{id=2, name='Bob'}
User{id=3, name='Charlie'}
```

### Important Notes:

- The reactive streams will emit values at different rates. In the case of this exercise, the integers are emitted every second, and so are the user objects.
- You can modify the action inside the `subscribe` method to perform other tasks, such as processing the data or performing side effects.

### Troubleshooting:

- **Uncommenting the Code:** If you uncomment the print statement for both streams, you may see mixed output because the two streams emit values at different times. This can cause the output to appear interleaved.

## Summary

In this exercise, we learned how to:

- Subscribe to reactive streams using `subscribe`.
- Process elements emitted by a stream asynchronously.
- Use `Flux` to handle streams of data like integers and user objects.

This model of programming allows you to react to events as they happen, without waiting for all events to be emitted first.

Feel free to try the exercise yourself or ask questions if something is unclear.
