### Subscribing to Flux and Mono

When using Project Reactor, the most common interfaces are `Flux` and `Mono`. These represent the core abstractions for reactive programming.

1. **Flux**: Represents an asynchronous sequence of items (0 to n items).
2. **Mono**: Represents a sequence of 0 or 1 item.

Even though `Flux` can technically emit a single item, it still conveys the intent of being a sequence of items, as opposed to `Mono`, which is explicitly for 0 or 1 items.

## How Reactive Streams Work

- **Reactive Streams** rely on the `Subscription` interface, which is the core of interaction between publisher and subscriber.
- The actual data is provided by a library (e.g., Reactor Core), not by core Java.
- **Project Reactor** simplifies the use of reactive streams by hiding the complexity of these interfaces and making it easier to interact with asynchronous sequences using `Flux` and `Mono`.

### Flux vs Mono

- **Flux**: Represents an asynchronous sequence of 0 to n items.
- **Mono**: Represents an asynchronous sequence of 0 or 1 item.

### Back Pressure in Flux

One important feature of `Flux` is **back pressure**. This is a concept where the publisher may send too many items too quickly for the subscriber to process. In such cases, the subscriber can tell the publisher to slow down.

An analogy could be:
- **Assembly Line**: You're a new employee, and the work is coming too fast for you to handle. You can ask the line to slow down until you're ready.

Back pressure ensures that the system remains balanced, and the subscriber can handle the incoming data at a manageable rate.

## Conclusion

In summary:
- **Flux** and **Mono** are higher-level abstractions used in Project Reactor to handle reactive streams.
- **Flux** is used for asynchronous sequences of 0 to n items, while **Mono** is for 0 or 1 item.
- **Back Pressure** is an essential feature of `Flux`, allowing the subscriber to manage the rate of data they consume.
