# Exercise Three

## Overview
The goal is to get a list of items. You don’t want each individual item, but a list of items.

## Flux to Stream Conversion
There’s a way you can convert the **Flux** metaphor to the **Stream** metaphor. A Flux represents a series of items over time, while a Stream represents a collection of items available all at once. The conversion process changes an asynchronous model (Flux) to a synchronous, in-memory model (Stream) where all elements are available at the same time.

### Conversion Process
Here’s how it works:
1. You have a **Flux** (stream of items).
2. There’s a method `toStream()` that converts the Flux into a Stream.
3. After conversion, you can use `toList()` to collect all elements into a list.

### Example Code:
```java
Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 10);
List<Integer> list = flux.toStream().collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println("List: " + list);
System.out.println("Size: " + list.size());
```

In this example, a `Flux` of integers is converted into a list, and the list is printed along with its size.

## Why is It Blocking?
- The Flux emits one item every second.
- The `toStream()` and `toList()` methods will wait for all the items to arrive.
- The operation is **blocking** because the program cannot proceed until all the items in the Flux are gathered.
- This is a **blocking operation** where the execution is paused until all elements are collected into the list.

### Key Points:
- The line that prints the list will not execute until all elements are collected.
- The blocking nature is due to waiting for all items to be available in the stream.
- This can be observed by the time it takes for the process to complete (e.g., waiting 10 seconds to collect 10 items).

## Conclusion
By converting the Flux to a Stream, you can collect all the elements into a list. However, be aware that this operation is blocking, and the program will wait until the Flux has emitted all its items before proceeding.
