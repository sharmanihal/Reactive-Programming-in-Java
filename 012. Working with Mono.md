# Reactive Programming with Mono

## Exercise 4: Working with Mono

### Task 1: Print the value from `in number` Mono when it emits

In this task, you'll be working with a **Mono**. A **Mono** represents a stream that can emit either one value or no value at all. In this exercise, we are only expecting one value from the Mono.

1. Create a Mono that emits a number.
2. Subscribe to the Mono and print the value when it's emitted.

```java
Mono<Integer> numberMono = Mono.just(42);
numberMono.subscribe(value -> System.out.println("Value emitted: " + value));
```

Once the value is emitted, the Mono is completed. You don't need to expect any more values.

### Task 2: Block the Mono and get the value

Now, you'll block the Mono to get the value into an integer variable. Since you want the value to be available before moving to the next line, youâ€™ll use the `block()` method.

```java
Mono<Integer> numberMono = Mono.just(42);
Integer value = numberMono.block();  // This will block until the value is emitted
System.out.println("Value: " + value);
```

Alternatively, you can use `blockOptional()` to get an `Optional<Integer>` in case the Mono does not emit any value:

```java
Mono<Integer> numberMono = Mono.just(42);
Optional<Integer> value = numberMono.blockOptional(); 
System.out.println("Value: " + value.orElse(null));
```

### Blocking vs Non-blocking

Blocking the Mono (with `block()` or `blockOptional()`) should be avoided in reactive programming because it defeats the purpose of asynchronous, non-blocking calls.

- **Non-blocking**: In a reactive approach, you can subscribe to the Mono and handle the result when it's ready. This doesn't block the thread.
- **Blocking**: If you need the result immediately, you block the thread using methods like `block()`.

When you're using `block()`, you're essentially forcing a wait for the result. This is fine in a test environment or a small, quick operation, but in a production system, you'd generally want to avoid blocking.

### Example with Complex Types

Monos can return more than just integers. You can return complex types such as a `Mono<User>`:

```java
Mono<User> userMono = Mono.just(new User("John", "Doe"));
userMono.subscribe(user -> System.out.println("User: " + user.getName()));
```

If you want to return a list, it can be done by wrapping it in a `Mono` like so:

```java
Mono<List<User>> userListMono = Mono.just(Arrays.asList(new User("John", "Doe"), new User("Jane", "Doe")));
userListMono.subscribe(users -> users.forEach(user -> System.out.println(user.getName())));
```

### Why Use `Mono`?

- A **Mono** is designed to emit zero or one value. This makes it useful for operations that complete quickly or may not return a value at all.
- Unlike **Flux**, which represents a stream of multiple values, **Mono** can only return one item, or none.

### Can a Mono Return a List?

Yes, a Mono can return a list or any other collection. Here's an example with a list of numbers:

```java
Mono<List<Integer>> numberListMono = Mono.just(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
numberListMono.subscribe(list -> list.forEach(System.out::println));
```

### Mono of Monos

You can also return a Mono of Monos, but it's generally advised to flatten them using operators like `flatMap` to avoid nested Monos, which can complicate the logic:

```java
Mono<Mono<Integer>> monoOfMono = Mono.just(Mono.just(42));
monoOfMono.flatMap(m -> m).subscribe(value -> System.out.println("Value: " + value));
```

### Should You Block?

While it's possible to block a Mono to get its value (using `block()` or `blockOptional()`), this goes against the principles of reactive programming, which encourages non-blocking calls. Blocking leads to performance bottlenecks and prevents the application from fully utilizing asynchronous programming features.

It's better to stick to a non-blocking approach by using `subscribe()` and handling the value when it's emitted.

### Can We Use Future with Flux?

Using a `CompletableFuture` with a `Flux` or `Mono` is possible, but it's redundant. `Mono` and `Flux` already provide mechanisms to handle asynchronous operations without blocking. Mixing paradigms like `CompletableFuture` and reactive programming just adds unnecessary complexity.

Instead, you should use `subscribe()` to handle results asynchronously and avoid blocking wherever possible.

### Conclusion

- **Mono** is used when you expect at most one value to be emitted.
- **Blocking** should be avoided in reactive programming, as it negates the benefits of non-blocking, asynchronous operations.
- Use the `block()` method sparingly, and prefer using `subscribe()` for handling emissions asynchronously.

### Key Takeaways

- `Mono.just(T)` is used to create a Mono that emits a single value.
- You can block on a Mono to get its value, but it is not recommended in reactive systems.
- Avoid `Mono` of `Mono` or nested reactive streams, as they can introduce unnecessary complexity.
