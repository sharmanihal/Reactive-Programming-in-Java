# Reactive Programming

### Definition
Reactive programming is a **declarative programming paradigm** concerned with **data streams** and the **propagation of change**.

#### Key Elements
1. **Declarative Programming**
   - Opposed to imperative programming, where all steps are explicitly defined.
   - In declarative programming, you declare what should happen, and the system ensures it occurs.

2. **Data Streams**
   - A stream of data is not just a single data element but a continuous flow of data over time.
   - Reactive programming enables working with these data streams efficiently.

3. **Propagation of Change**
   - Changes in one part of the data stream automatically propagate to other dependent parts.

### Characteristics
- Reactive programming allows for expressing **static** (e.g., arrays) and **dynamic** (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease.
- Facilitates **automatic propagation of changes** within the execution model.

### Misconceptions
- **Reactive != Asynchronous**
  - Asynchronous programming involves tasks not executed sequentially.
  - Reactive programming can be synchronous or asynchronous.
  - Not all asynchronous programming is reactive, and vice versa.

### Use Cases
1. **User Events (UI)**
   - Example: Reacting to a button click.
   - A function executes in response to a user action.

2. **IO Responses**
   - Example: Handling the completion of a file read or a network request.
   - Executes a specific function when the operation finishes.

### Simplistic Definition
Reactive programming is about **reacting to something**:
- A trigger occurs (e.g., a user clicks a button).
- You react to the trigger and execute a response (e.g., run a specific function).

### Comparison to Event-Driven Programming
- Similar to event-driven programming in the sense that a trigger leads to a reaction.
- Event-driven programming may have broader implications, but reactive programming focuses on streams and the propagation of changes.

### Why Server-Side Java Developers Should Care
Reactive programming is often associated with UI/Frontend development. However, its principles can significantly impact server-side development:

1. **Server-Side Web Development**
   - Typical workflow:
     - Handle a request.
     - Process data (e.g., fetch from a database, call APIs).
     - Return a response.
   - This flow seems synchronous (do A → do B → do C → return response).
   - However, server-side development often involves:
     - Handling multiple concurrent requests.
     - Waiting for IO operations.

2. **The Reactive Case**
   - HTTP requests involve waiting for responses.
   - Reactive programming can optimize:
     - Concurrent request handling.
     - Non-blocking operations.
   - Improves resource utilization and system responsiveness.

By adopting reactive programming paradigms, server-side developers can build more efficient and scalable systems.
