# Java Reactive Programming Course Overview

## Course Introduction

Welcome to this course on **Java Reactive Programming**. This course will focus on reactive programming in Java, specifically using **Project Reactor**. Reactive programming is in a high-adoption stage due to its advantages and growing popularity. In this course, we will:

- Explore why reactive programming is gaining traction.
- Understand why and when to use reactive programming.
- Learn how to approach problems with a reactive mindset.
- Dive into the practical aspects of reactive programming with **Project Reactor**.

### Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of reactive programming.
- Learn how to "think reactive" and adopt a different problem-solving approach.
- Overcome the learning curve and achieve the "click" moment in understanding reactive programming.

## Agenda

### 1. Default Programming Model in Java

- Overview of the **blocking programming model**, the default model in Java.
- Characteristics of blocking programming:
  - Sequential request handling.
  - Waiting for responses while blocking further operations.
- Limitations of the blocking model.

### 2. Reactive Programming Model

- Key differences between blocking and reactive programming.
- How reactive programming solves the limitations of the default model.
- Building **scalable reactive code** using **Project Reactor**.

### 3. Project Reactor

- Why **Project Reactor** is the library of choice:
  - Maximum momentum and integration with Spring Boot.
  - Popularity among cloud providers like Azure.
- Alternative libraries (e.g., RxJava) and their similarities.
- Introduction to **reactive streams** and **operators**:
  - Transforming streams using operators.
  - Essential operators to learn and use.

### 4. Patterns, Best Practices, and Pitfalls

- Common mistakes and how to avoid them.
- Patterns to follow for clean and efficient reactive code.
- Best practices for working with Project Reactor.

### 5. Integration with Spring Boot

- How reactive programming fits into Spring Boot applications.
- Building Spring Boot applications in a reactive manner.
- Practical demonstrations and examples.
