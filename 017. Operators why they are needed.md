# Spring MVC Reactive Controller: Flux and Mono

## Avoiding Blocking in Controllers

To optimize performance, we move computations into the framework or web service to prevent blocking in various parts of the controller. In Spring MVC, reactive controllers allow us to avoid blocking by returning objects of type `Mono` or `Flux` instead of directly processing and holding data in the controller.

For example:
- The controller method returns a `Mono`.
- The Spring framework handles the `Mono` callback, allowing the web server to process it asynchronously.
- This avoids holding up the controller.

### Challenges with Reactive Programming
Reactive programming isn't always straightforward. For instance, consider the following scenario:

1. Fetch a user object using a `Mono`.
2. Check if the user has an active flag.
3. Fetch additional user details.
4. Populate the user object and return it.

This cannot be achieved by simply subscribing to the `Mono`. Subscribing blocks the code and removes you from the reactive chain.

### Handling Complex Logic with Operators
Instead of blocking or subscribing prematurely, we use operators to process data within the reactive pipeline. These operators allow manipulation of `Flux` and `Mono` while staying reactive.

#### Example of Operators

Using a Java collection stream:
```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.stream()
    .filter(element -> element != null)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```
The same idea applies to `Flux` and `Mono`:
```java
flux.filter(element -> element != null)
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```
Here:
- `filter` processes elements and returns a new `Flux`.
- `subscribe` acts on the processed elements.

### Implementing Reactive Logic
To handle a case where you need to filter users with an active flag, you can:

```java
Flux<User> activeUsers = service.getUserFlux()
    .filter(user -> user.isActive());
return activeUsers;
```

#### Explanation:
- `service.getUserFlux()` returns a `Flux<User>`.
- `filter` ensures only users with an active flag remain in the stream.
- The controller returns the filtered `Flux` without blocking.

### Understanding Reactive Operators
Reactive operators like `filter` and `map` allow manipulation of the data stream:
- `filter`: Retains elements matching a condition.
- `map`: Transforms elements in the stream.
- `flatMap`: Transforms elements into other reactive types.

Each operator returns a new `Flux` or `Mono`, enabling further processing without subscribing or blocking.

#### Execution
Reactive streams operate based on events:
- When an event is emitted, the `filter` operator processes it.
- The resulting event triggers the next operation in the pipeline, such as `subscribe`.

This ensures that processing remains asynchronous and non-blocking.

## Comparing Collection Streams and Reactive Streams

### Similarities
Reactive streams (Flux/Mono) share many concepts with Java collection streams:
- Both use functional-style operators like `filter`, `map`, and `flatMap`.
- Both return a new stream after applying an operation.

### Differences
Reactive streams operate asynchronously, processing events as they are emitted. In contrast, Java collection streams process data synchronously and require all elements to be available upfront.

### Summary
By leveraging reactive operators, you can manipulate `Flux` and `Mono` streams without blocking, maintaining the reactive paradigm throughout your application.
